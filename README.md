# Machine-Learning-Methods
A collection of machine learning methods that I created based on a book written by Dios Kurniawan, M.Sc.

In this repository there will be several methods used in machine learning that are made in a simple way so that they are easy to understand for beginners.
The methods available in this repository are:
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Tree
4. Naive Bayes
5. Neural Network
6. Churn Prediction
7. Clustering
8. Market Basket Analysis
9. Computer Vision
